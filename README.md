# SpaceShip
A space ship game implemented by CodeName One package of Java

Implemented a Spaceship game using Java Codename One package. A player could control a spaceship to move or launch missiles using keyboard. There were many non-player spaceships and asteroids randomly flying in the map and bounced back when they reached to the edges of the map, and players could get points by destroying those flying objects.
